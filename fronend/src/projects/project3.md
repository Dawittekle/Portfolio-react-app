**PlayJS** is a web platform that brings together a variety of fun, engaging, and lightweight JavaScript games. Built from scratch with vanilla JavaScript, these games are designed to be simple yet entertaining, accessible right in your browser.

## 📝 Description

PlayJS is my personal gaming hub where I showcase the collection of mini-games I’ve built over time while learning and experimenting with JavaScript. From classic arcade-style games to puzzle challenges, PlayJS demonstrates creativity and problem-solving through code.

Some of the featured games include:

- 🐍 **Snake Game** – A classic snake game built with the Canvas API.
- 🧩 **Tic-Tac-Toe** – Simple 2-player logic game.
- 🏃 **Dino Run Clone** – A Chrome dino game replica.
- 🎲 **Guess the Number** – Fun number guessing logic.
- 🧱 **Brick Breaker** – A breakout-style game using collision detection.
- ⏱️ **Memory Match** – A card matching puzzle game.

All games are playable directly on the web platform.
